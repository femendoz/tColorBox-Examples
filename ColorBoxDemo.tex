% Author: femendoz - fmendoza@duck.com
% This document shows how to create new environments with tColorBox package.
% The environments are: Definition, Theorem, Lemma, Corollary, Proposition, Example and Proof.
% Each environment has a different color and an icon at the top right corner of the box.
% The environments are breakable, so they can be split between pages.
% Feel free to modify the colors, the icons, and the styles of the boxes, since this is just a template.

% Now, we define the new functions and associate them with the styles.

\NewTcbTheorem[number within = section]%
{Definition}{Definition}{defstyle, breakable}{def}
% The first argument is the name of the environment.
% The second argument is the title of the environment.
% The third argument is the style of the environment, and if it is breakable or not (remove the breakable option if you don't want it).
% The fourth argument is the label prefix of the environment (i.e. a label of a Definition will be def:label).
% If you don't want to use a counter, either change the option 'number within = section' to 'no counter'.
% or use Definiton* instead of Definition. Take into account that the label will not work in this case.
% The same applies to the other environments.

Even if we are not using default environments, we can still make references to them. 
For example, we can refer to the Definition \ref{def:def1} or to the Theorem \ref{theo:Lorem}.
